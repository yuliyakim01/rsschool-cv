### Summary
I am a third culture kid. Born in Uzbekistan, where I only spoke Russian and belonged to the ethnically Korean minority. Growing up in Central Asia, I was a part of a vibrant international community, attending international schools and building connections with people from various diverse backgrounds. At 19, I moved to Denver, Colorado, alone and during the pandemic to pursue my education at the University of Denver and build a new life.

Adjusting to a new country, I faced the challenge of starting from scratch - creating social circles and navigating a completely new culture. This university experience not only strengthened my resilience and adaptiveness, but also ignited my passion for activism, sustainability, and social equity. 

I recently graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Psychology from the University of Denver. My academic journey provided me with a unique intersection of skills in technology and human behavior, focusing on user-centered design and specializing in front-end development with proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript along with programming proficiency in Java and C/C++.

My travels and international upbringing have instilled in me a deep appreciation for sustainability and a commitment to giving back to my community. I am passionate about using technology to drive social change and ensure ethical and equitable AI. My goal is to use my skills to create inclusive digital solutions that benefit diverse communities and support sustainability initiatives. I am dedicated to contributing to social justice causes and supporting my family and community back home.
